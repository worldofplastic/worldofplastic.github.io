  The earth is literally filled with plastic, you see it everywhere you go, but how are we going to get rid of all that plastic. Plastic takes years to perish, so here are 5 easy things you can do to help stop the plastic soup.
  <br><br>
  </p>
  <ol>
      <li>Just bring your own shopping bag to the store instead of these one use plastic bags they give you there. Even these thin bags take years to perish. And the worst thing you can do with them is just throw them away on the ground when you are done with it. When you just bring your own bag to the store you only use one in like a couple of years. When a lot of people do this the plastic gets some time to perish and the plastic soap will reduce.</li>
      <li>Do not buy bottled water. When you use the same bottle you bought once you can just refill it every time and they don’t have to make new bottles people can throw on the ground. Also just don’t throw your own bottle on the ground and when you see someone else doing that you can say him he has to pick it up.</li>
      <li>Another really easy one, just say no the straws the restaurants want to give you. Every time you look at a beach you always see a couple of straws just lying there and that is not even half of all of them. Some people who buy drinks in a store and take it with them and when they are done drinking they just throw their beaker on the ground with the plastic straw.</li>
      <li>Just clean things up a bit, when you see something on the ground pick it up and throw it in the bin, or when you see someone throwing it on the ground say it to him. You can also make an appointment with the people in your street to do every month a cleaning day and then with all the people in the street you go clean the street up.</li>
      <li>Think about what you buy, buy as many not plastic prepacked food and drinks in the stores, if something is only prepacked just do not buy it. If you really need it though you have to make sure it is not double prepacked but just once when everyone does this we can reduce a lot of plastic waste.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><br><br>
    I hope you used these tips and you also did actually use them. And lets hope a lot of people do so to stop plastic waste.
