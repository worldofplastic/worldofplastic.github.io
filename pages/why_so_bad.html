      <p>
        The world is producing more plastic trash than ever, and a little little bit only 7% of it gets recycled. The plastic is everywhere: on the open sea, on the sea floor, on beaches, in city's and also in front of you. There it not only disfigures the beauty of nature and leads to economic losses but also has alarming effects on nature, animals and most important on us.
        <br><br>
        The real cause of the plastic pollution of is our uncouth way of using plastics. Making use of plastic where it is not necessary, littering, and the way of waste management all lead to increasing amounts getting in our waters. More than 90% of al the plastic is made to only use it one time. Even where we don't believe it, we pollute. Take as a example by washing clothes made partly from plastic. The plastic also gets in the water and don't come out any more. Most people don't know that the cloths they were are partly made of plastic. That's the same as the shampoo you put in your hair that is also made from plastic, the same as the bottle, also made from plastic.
        <br>
        A single plastic microbead can be 1 million times more toxic than the water around it.
        <br>
        Our ocean is a network of currents that circulate water around the world- called gyres.
        <br>
        Small ocean animals, like fish, ingest tiny plastic particles. These toxic particles pass on to us when we eat seafood.
