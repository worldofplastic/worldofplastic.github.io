            <p>
                Everywhere on earth plastic is used. It is used from the newest tech gadgets to the hand bags you get in the store when you buy something.  <br><br>
                Plastic is very harmful for the environment. It destroys lots of live but it all start when you throw the plastic away on the street or in the nature. Plastic always ends up in the sea. It can get there by wind or by rivers. But somehow it will get there. When it is in the sea the ocean currents take it to some spots in the ocean where it forms a large pile of plastic. But everywhere when plastic gets in the sea or water in general it will leak chemicals were it is made of and those are quit poisonous. Lots of akes are polluted with plastic they may seem clear but mostly they aren’t. The plastic has probably already leaked their chemicals into the water and caused lots of water animals to die. All the plastic that stays in the water for a long time is getting smaller how longer it stays in the water. It will finally end up in very small pieces. Those pieces are eaten by fish and other animals. Most animals that life near water have lots of plastic in their stomach! And those die because of it. This destroys the nature on earth it should be stopped now!
